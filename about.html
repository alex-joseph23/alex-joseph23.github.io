  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m Alexandra Joseph, a full stack developer who loves learning, building, and improving with every project I take on.
    Coding has become something I’m genuinely passionate about, and I’m always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy working on both the front and back end, bringing ideas to life through clean, functional code and thoughtful design.
    There’s nothing better than seeing a project come together and knowing I built something that works and looks great.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m excited to keep creating, collaborating, and finding projects that push me to get better every day.
